# odin-etch-a-sketch

This project was to build an Etch-a-Sketch copy. To do this I had to use JavaScript to generate square divs inside a container, then creating an event listener so if
the user hovered over one of these divs it would turn to black. Then added the ability for the user to reset/change the number of square divs.

Still TO-DO:
Instead of just black squares, want to make it so that a random colour is used, but black is used on every 10th square.
